# Bio

{{% box %}}
My name is Marcus. I was born in Minnesota in 1996. I grew up in a really small town in northen minnesota, I won't name it because you most likely have never heard of it anyways _(Wrenshall, MN)_. Now i'm a Minneapolis based developer and student. I attend the University of Minnesota for Computer Science. My love for technology came when I saw my grandfather building and fixing old computers. I remember looking inside a computer and being fascinated with the thought of how it all worked. I built my first computer when I was 16. I got into coding shortly after. Seeing that almost everything is web based nowadays I naturally started learning and researching web technologies, building projects and applications for the web.

*Currently I am an aspiring full-stack web developer and have been experimenting with technologies and frameworks like:*

+ HTML & CSS
+ Javscript
+ Django
+ Vue.js
+ React
+ Material Design by Google
+ Hugo
+ Node.js
+ Ionic/Cordova
