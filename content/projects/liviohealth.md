## About

Livio Health Group is a state of the art, nontraditional healthcare company. They provide on-call mobile urgent care and on-site healthcare. Livio Health Group is a St. Paul based healthcare company.

## Website

I built Livio a website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the Hugo theme [Agency](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/agency/) theme. I gathered and wrote all the content on the website. I wrote and edited some javascript/jQuery to fix some animations and issues with the modals.
I also implemented Google reCaptcha into the contact form, hosted the site using netflify and migrated DNS records successfully with no downtime. This project allowed me to become more familiar with DNS and web hosting as I went through the transfer process and configured DNS records.

See the [Livio Health Group Website](https://www.liviohealth.org/) website.
The source code for the site is on github [here](https://github.com/liviohealth/LivioHealthWebsite)
